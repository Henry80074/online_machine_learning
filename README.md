# online_machine_learning
This is an 'proof of concept' online machine learning project that pulls data from coin geckos API (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin) and the fear and greed index API (https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)
This model is trained using 45 days prior data to predict the next days price. It automatically updates and trains on the new data it receives. It can not be considered useful for financial decision making. Especially with tether being a ponzi scheme.
